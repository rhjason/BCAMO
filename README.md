In programming classes and algorithms the first few weeks are always getting the student to convert binary to Hexadecimal or Octal and learning about 2's complement. One day I got annoyed enough with having to convert by hand and made this program to convert the values for me. Sadly the professor did not give me an A for being able to make a program to convert numbers for me.

Conversions are annoying especially when they are a large number and to be done by hand. I noticed that even after taking Matlab, C++, etc. in other higher level classes such as Computer Organization, and Verilog, early assignments still constantly consist of: Convert this number from base M to base N (where M and N are generally 2, 10, or 16). And this kind of assignment just feels like busywork. So I took it upon myself to make a base conversion tool so that my life is made easier.
