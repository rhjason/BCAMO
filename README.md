Personal Project for fun and applying programming skills to use

Conversions are annoying especially when they are a large number and to be done by hand. I noticed that even after taking Matlab, C++, etc. in other higher level classes such as Computer Organization, and Verilog, early assignments still constantly consist of: Convert this number from base M to base N (where M and N are generally 2, 10, or 16). And this kind of assignment just feels like busywork. So I took it upon myself to make a base conversion tool so that my life is made easier.
